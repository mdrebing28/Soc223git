## Idea

I was thinking of creating a project that will predict how many points (G/A) a player will have by the end of the season or which team will make it to the Stanley Cup playoffs. It will give me a projection basing off their current stats.

I was hoping to use fastRhockey or hockeyR and if neither of those two work I might create my own data set.
